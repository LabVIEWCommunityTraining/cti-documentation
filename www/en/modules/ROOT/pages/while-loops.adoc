== Lesson Instructions

The While Loop executes the sub-diagram until a specific condition
occurs. It will always execute at least one time.

In this case, you want the LED to continually blink on and off until a
`Stop` button is pressed. You can create this using the previously built
program with the For Loop.

* Firstly, Right-click on the edge of the For Loop, and select `Replace
with While Loop`

* Now the For Loop has been replaced, the Loop Count is not connected.
This is not needed for a While Loop and can be deleted.

* To add a `Stop` boolean, switch to the front panel window and right
click where you want to place the button. The Controls palette will
appear, select `Boolean` and pick a button. The example uses a `Push
Button` but any will work.

* Back on the Block Diagram move the new Control Boolean into the While
Loop and wire it up to the Conditional Terminal in the bottom right
corner. If the Button on the Front Panel is pressed when the program is
running then the Loop will end and the `blinking` LED will stop.
