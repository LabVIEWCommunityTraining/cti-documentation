== Setting Pico Firmware


Each  Raspberry Pi Pico will need the course firmware installed on it.

Hold the BOOTSEL button down on the Pico and plug the USB cable into the computer. The Pico will act as a flash drive.

image::in_028.00_BOOTSEL.png[]

In the Linux VM select Devices>>USB>>Raspberry Pi RP2 Boot [0100] (or similar)

image::in_029.00_DevicesUSB.png[]

This will mount the hard drive on the desktop

image::in_030.00_DeviceAsUSBflashDrive.png[]

Next drag and drop the course firmware file onto the Pico. This will install and the Pico LED will flash green 6 times.

[NOTE]
--
For Lesson 5, you’ll be testing the Pico board’s analog inputs. The course manual references a blue board with two potentiometers, but this specific board is not included with the hardware provided. Instead, you’ll only need a single potentiometer for this lesson. Please ensure you have one available before proceeding.
