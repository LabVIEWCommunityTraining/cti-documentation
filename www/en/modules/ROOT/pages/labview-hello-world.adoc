== Lesson Instructions

The LabVIEW version of a “Hello World” program is to make a piece of
hardware do something basic, usually it is turning an LED On and Off.

Load LabVIEW and select a New VI.

Setup the screen like this:

image::cm_006.00_SetupScreen_BlockDiagram_FrontPanel_Emulator.png[]

In LabVIEW a VI is a Virtual Instrument is equivalent to a function or
module in other languages. A LabVIEW program is made up of 1 or more
VIs.

* In the block diagram right-click and navigate to the HandsOnPi2040
Driver Palette.

Drag and drop Initialize.vi, WriteDO.vi and Close.vi onto the block diagram
as shown below.

NOTE: The Run-arrow is broken (the run arrow appears in the top left corner), if you press it, it will list all the reasons why it`s broken.

* LabVIEW will not let you run the source-code until these errors are
sorted. Close the Error List and select all of the Vis. (Left-click drag
on mouse).

* Press kbd:[Ctrl+Space] to bring up quick drop and kbd:[Ctrl+W] to wire the VIs
together. Quick drop is an extremely useful productivity tool that ships
with LabVIEW. It allows you to automate repetitive tasks with a few key
combos.

If you press the Run arrow now you will notice that there are only 2
issues listed, good job!

* Press Ctrl-H to bring up the context help window. Hover over
Initialize.vi.

NOTE: The VISA resource name is *bold*. This means that it needs to have an input.

* Now, right-click on VISA Resource Name Initialize.vi and select create
constant.

If you press the Run arrow now you will notice that there is only 1
issue left.

This VI needs its Output and DO Value (True) wiring. So let's create
constants for them. Use the arrow on the right to select an output.

It's nice to have the constant label shown for booleans.

* Right-click on the `True` Boolean Constant. This will bring up a drop
down window, hover over `Visible Items` and select `Label`.

We will also need to create a Constant for the VISA Reference Terminal. Like before, Right-click the `VISA Resource Name` tip strip and create a Constant

image::cm_018.00_Initialize-IOconstantWired.png[]

Constants are terminals on the block diagram that supply fixed data
values to the diagram. We`ll discuss data types etc. later in the
session.

* Finally let's wire in a couple of outputs.

* Right-click on IDN for Initialize.vi and select `Create Indicator`.
Then we need an error out, so Right-click at the bottom the Close.vi and
select `Create Indicator`.

image::cm_021.00_Close-ErrorOutput-Wired.png[]

image::cm_023.00_Identity-ErrorOut-Indicators-on-FrontPanel.png[]

Notice how the Indicators appear on the Front Panel. We`ll discuss
block-diagrams and front panels in a bit.

Now we have a running program!

However, you will notice the we`ll have an error.

* We can interrogate the error message to try and get a clue as to why
it all went so wrong. Sometimes it can even be helpful.

image::cm_025.00_RightClick-ExplainError.png[]

In this case it is!

* The VIs don`t know who they are talking to. To fix this, hardware
users need to set the correct VISA reference from the `VISA` drop down
box.. For Emulator users click the `Copy` button, as seen in the image
below and paste the reference in, if you have hardware refresh and
select the ASRL reference.

* Now press run again.

Here we can see that no errors were apparent and Identity has a value.

But more importantly the LED on the hardware has turned on.
