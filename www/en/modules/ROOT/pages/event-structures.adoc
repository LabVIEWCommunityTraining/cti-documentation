== Lesson Instructions

An Event Structure waits until a certain event occurs, then executes the
appropriate case to handle that event. In this example, we want to press
a buttons and the corresponding light to turn on.

* First lets delete the while loop and its contents. Click on the While
Loop and press the delete key. Do the same for the `True` constant. Then
remove the broken wires with kbd:[Ctrl+B].

* Right-click to bring up the Functions Palette, hover over `Structures`
then select `Event Structure.` Place the Event Structure on the Block
Diagram.

* Wire the Initialize VI and the Close VI through the Event Structure.

* Add a new Event Case by Right-clicking on the Selector Label, and select
`Add Event Case.`

* Add the WriteDO.vi by bringing up the Functions Palette, hover over
`Instrument I/O`, `Instr Drivers,` `HandsOnPi2040,` and select
`WriteDO.vi.

* Drag the sub VI inside the Event Structure and wire it up. Right-click
the Output terminal and create a Constant.

* Change the Output from `No DO – Error` to `DO1` by clicking the drop down arrow
on the Output Constant.

* Next we need to add a button for the Digital Output. Go to the Front
Panel, and Right-click anywhere to bring up the Controls Palette. Hover
over `Boolean,` and select `Push Button`

* Wire the new Boolean Control into the `DO Value` terminal.

image::cm_059.00_EventStructureWired-BooleanControlTerminalWiredToWriteDO.png[]

* Right-click on the Label Selector as we need to `Edit Events Handled
by This Case.`

image::cm_060.00_RightClick-EditEventsHandledByThisCase.png[]

* This will bring up the `Edit Events` window. Select `Boolean.`

image::cm_061.00_EventStructure-EditEventsWindow-Select-Boolean.png[]

* This Event Case is now complete. We will need 3 more Event Cases, each
one corresponding to a LED. The easiest way to do this is to Right-click
the Label Selector, and select `Duplicate Event Case.`

* Select `Boolean 2` on the Edit Events window.

image::cm_063.00_EventStructure-EditEventsWindow-Select-Boolean2.png[]

* It's important to change the DO Constant when the case has been
duplicated. (DO1 for Boolean, DO2 for Boolean 2, etc.) Duplicate this
case 2 more times for DO3, and DO4.

* At this point your Front Panel may look a little messy, take some time to
clean it up. This will make it easier to use when you have finished
building the program.

NOTE: You will be able to Run the program now, however, it will Stop after one Boolean has been selected. We can make this more efficient.

* Back on the Block Diagram we will need to add a While Loop. Right
click to bring up the Functions Palette, hover over `Structures` and
select `While Loop.`

image::cm_067.00_RightClick-FunctionsPalette-Structures-WhileLoop.png[]

* Place the While Loop around the Event Structure.

image::cm_068.00_WhileLoopAroundEventStructure.png[]

* Go to the Front Panel, so we can add a `Stop` button that we`ll
connect to the Loop Condition. Right-click to bring up the Controls
Palette, hover over `Boolean, then select `Stop Button.`

image::cm_069.00_RightClick-ControlsPalette-Boolean-StopButton.png[]

* We will also need to create a new Event Case for this Stop button. Right
click on the Selector Label and select `Add Event Case.`

image::cm_070.00_RightClick-AddEventCase-ForStopButton.png[]

* Place the `Stop` control inside the new case.

image::cm_071.00_EventStructureWired-StopButtonInsideEventCase.png[]

* Right-click the Selector Label and select `Edit Events Handled by This Case`

image::cm_072.00_RightClick-EditEventsHandledByThisCase-StopButton.png[]

* When the `Edit Events` window pops up choose the `stop` option in the
`Event Sources` table.

image::cm_073.00_EventStructure-EditEventsWindow-Select-Stop.png[]

* Our last step is to wire a `True` constant to the Loop condition. Right
click to bring up the Functions Palette, hover over `Boolean` and select
`True Constant.`
* Place the Constant inside the Event Structure.

image::cm_074.00_RightClick-FunctionsPalette-Boolean-TrueConstant.png[]

* Wire the constant to the Loop Condition, like the image below.

image::cm_075.00_EventStructureWired-TrueConstant-ToStopTerminal.png[]

* The program will now run successfully. You will be able to turn the LEDs on
and off as many times as you want. You can use the Stop button to stop
the execution of the program.
