== VIs (Virtual Instruments)

Programs in LabVIEW are called VIs (Virtual Instruments). In other
programming languages a VI is similar to a function or a subroutine. A
VI includes a Front Panel and a Block Diagram, the VIs Icon and its
Connector Pane.

Front Panel::
The front panel window is the user interface for the VI. You create the
window with controls and indicators, these are the interactive input and
output terminals of the VI.

Block Diagram:: The Block Diagram is where you will create the code for your program.
The block diagram will implement graphical representations of functions
to control the objects on the front panel. Objects on the front panel
will appear as terminals on the block diagram.

Icons, Connector Panes, and SubVIs:: The icon and connector pane allow you to use and view the VI in another
VI. This is called a SubVI, to use a SubVI you must build a connector
pane. Customising the Icon is recommended to help with reading and
understanding the program.
The Icon is displayed in the upper right corner of the VI, it is a
graphical representation of the VI. The icon can be customised with text
and images to help identify what the VI does.
The connector pane is a set of terminals on the icon the corresponds
to the controls and indicators of the VI.

== Data Types

Each variable in a program must have a data type. The data types
determines what type of value the variable will hold.

Numeric –

* Integer (int) – whole numbers (e.g., -700, 0, 700)
* Floating point (float) – numbers with fractions (decimals) (e.g.,
700.0, 0.7)

Boolean – represents 2 states (e.g., true, or false, 1 or 0)

String – sequence of characters, digits, or symbols – always treated as
text (e.g., hello)

Enumerated type – predefined unique values (can be text or numerical)
(e.g., rock (0) jazz (1)

Character – a single letter, digit, punctuation mark, symbol, or blank
space.

Array – stores multiple elements in a specific order. Note: black means
no datatype selected. Drop another datatype into the array to make an
array of that datatype.

NOTE: Right-click on a data type terminal and select `View as Icon` depending on your preference. The 2^nd^ row shows the terminals as icons.

== While Loops

While Loops allow portions of a program to execute repeatedly until a
certain condition is met.

. Iteration Terminal – the iteration terminal provides the current loop iteration.
. Conditional Terminal – Evaluates a Boolean input value at the end of each loop iteration, if the conditional terminal is met then the loop stops.


== For Loops

A For Loop executes a sub-diagram a certain number of times. This value
is wired to the Count Terminal (N).

. Iteration Loop – Indicates the number of completed iterations.
. Count Terminal – Specifies the number of times to execute the code
inside the For Loop.

== Event Structures

An Event Structure waits until an event occurs, then executes the
appropriate case to handle that event.

. The Timeout terminals specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for
an event before timing out.
. The event selector label specifies which events cause the displayed
case to execute.
. The Event Data Node identifies the data LabVIEW returns when an event
occurs
