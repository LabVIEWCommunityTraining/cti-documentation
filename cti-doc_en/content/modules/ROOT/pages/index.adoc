When imported open the new VM

NOTE: Tip, the right ctrl button will free your mouse if the VM steals it.

Login as root, this solves a lot of issues with LabVIEW and Linux. Password is the same as the normal login. (labviewtraining)

Tap in your user account details and the LabVIEW license will activate.

If you want to remove a license, the .lc file can be found in /root/natinst/.config/LabVIEW-2022/

image::in_017.00_LabVIEW_lc_file.png[]

LabVIEW will now load as normal

== Install Course Materials

image::in_018.00_AccessCommunityTrainingResources.png[]

We’ve modified the Getting Started Window, this link will take you to the CTI Github repo.

image::in_019.00_GitHubCTImaterial.png[]

Select the course you wish to give.

== Installing Drivers


Open up ../4) LabVIEW Instrument Drivers in a window

Using the File System icon on the desktop navigate to /usr/local/natinst/LabVIEW-2022-64/instr.lib

Drag HandsOnPi2040 directory to ../instr.lib

image::in_025.00_DragInstrumentDriverTOinstr.lib.png[]

Open LabVIEW and create a new VI. Check the drivers are in the instr.lib as expected

image::in_026.00_HandsOnInstrumentPalette.png[]


== Making Emulator Exe run in Linux


The file CTIPicoVISAEmulator.exe needs to be set to be executable

image::in_027.00_MarkEXE.png[]

== Setting Pico Firmware


Each  Raspberry Pi Pico will need the course firmware installed on it.

Hold the BOOTSEL button down on the Pico and plug the USB cable into the computer. The Pico will act as a flash drive.

image::in_028.00_BOOTSEL.png[]

In the Linux VM select Devices>>USB>>Raspberry Pi RP2 Boot [0100] (or similar)

image::in_029.00_DevicesUSB.png[]

This will mount the hard drive on the desktop

image::in_030.00_DeviceAsUSBflashDrive.png[]

Next drag and drop the course firmware file onto the Pico. This will install and the Pico LED will flash green 6 times.

image::in_031.00_DragFirmware.png[]

== Connect and Test the Pico


In the Linux VM select Devices>>USB>>Raspberry Pi Pico [0100] (or similar)

image::in_032.00_ConnectVMtoUSBdevice.png[]

Connect the Pico


== Hardware

Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico W.
USA and UK Suppliers - We're probably going to standardise on Pico-W

== Support Software


Part of the idea behind this project is there to be zero costs for the software side of things.
The VM is pre-loaded with LibreOffice – it is the preferred medium for Manuals
The VM also has a program called Pinta – this is a layered graphics program similar to Paint.net. The wiring diagrams are made with this.
