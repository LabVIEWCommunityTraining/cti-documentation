== Setting Pico Firmware


Each  Raspberry Pi Pico will need the course firmware installed on it.

Hold the BOOTSEL button down on the Pico and plug the USB cable into the computer. The Pico will act as a flash drive.

image::in_028.00_BOOTSEL.png[]

In the Linux VM select Devices>>USB>>Raspberry Pi RP2 Boot [0100] (or similar)

image::in_029.00_DevicesUSB.png[]

This will mount the hard drive on the desktop

image::in_030.00_DeviceAsUSBflashDrive.png[]

Next drag and drop the course firmware file onto the Pico. This will install and the Pico LED will flash green 6 times.

image::in_031.00_DragFirmware.png[]

== Connect and Test the Pico


In the Linux VM select Devices>>USB>>Raspberry Pi Pico [0100] (or similar)

image::in_032.00_ConnectVMtoUSBdevice.png[]

Connect the Pico

== Support Software


Part of the idea behind this project is there to be zero costs for the software side of things.
The VM is pre-loaded with LibreOffice – it is the preferred medium for Manuals
The VM also has a program called Pinta – this is a layered graphics program similar to Paint.net. The wiring diagrams are made with this.
