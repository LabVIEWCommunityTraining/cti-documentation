=== [#anchor-2]####Optional: Setting up the Hardware 

If you have the hardware for this course then you will need to set up
and wire it as shown in the image
below.image:Pictures/10000201000003930000030165C94B1D606E5457.png[image,width=588,height=495]

=== [#anchor-3]####Lesson Instructions

The LabVIEW version of a “Hello World” program is to make a piece of
hardware do something basic, usually it is turning an LED On and Off.

Load LabVIEW and select a New VI.

image:Pictures/100000000000036700000243000AC9CEC77DEE46.png[image,width=462,height=307]

Setup the screen like this:

image:Pictures/100000000000072B0000039E3CAD2D3874009E4F.png[image,width=602,height=304]

In LabVIEW a VI is a Virtual Instrument is equivalent to a function or
module in other languages. A LabVIEW program is made up of 1 or more
VIs.

* In the block diagram right-click and navigate to the HandsOnPi2040
Driver Palette.

image:Pictures/1000020100000524000003B778FEA9D131DB7A2A.png[image,width=582,height=421]

* 
* image:Pictures/100000000000033A000001C861119305A83046D7.png[image,width=551,height=304]Drag
and drop Initialize.vi, WriteDO.vi and Close.vi onto the block diagram
as shown below.

_Notice that the Run-arrow is broken (the run arrow appears in the top
left corner), if you press it, it will list all the reasons why it’s
broken_.

image:Pictures/10000000000001EB000001975DA530E39D30242F.png[image,width=490,height=406]

* LabVIEW will not let you run the source-code until these errors are
sorted. Close the Error List and select all of the Vis. (Left-click drag
on mouse).

* Press Ctrl+space to bring up quick drop and Ctrl+W to wire the VIs
together. Quick drop is an extremely useful productivity tool that ships
with LabVIEW. It allows you to automate repetitive tasks with a few key
combos.

image:Pictures/10000000000000CD0000004283D225DF9AC718C0.png[image,width=205,height=65]

If you press the Run arrow now you will notice that there are only 2
issues listed, good job!

* Press Ctrl-H to bring up the context help window. Hover over
Initialize.vi.
+

image:Pictures/1000000000000183000001040C9A888F8F206406.png[image,width=323,height=217]

_Notice that VISA resource name is *bold*. This means that it needs to
have an input._

* Now, right-click on VISA Resource Name Initialize.vi and select create
constant.

If you press the Run arrow now you will notice that there is only 1
issue left.

image:Pictures/1000000000000174000000E2B513B59FB4D0F5AB.png[image,width=371,height=226]

This VI needs it’s Output and DO Value (True) wiring. So let’s create
constants for them. Use the arrow on the right to select an output.

image:Pictures/1000000000000103000000B083C68EBE97FE6341.png[image,width=259,height=176]

image:Pictures/10000201000000A50000007C627BA86CD5BD2783.png[image,width=165,height=124]It’s
nice to have the constant label shown for booleans.

* Right click on the ‘True’ Boolean Constant. This will bring up a drop
down window, hover over ‘Visible Items’ and select ‘Label’.

image:Pictures/10000201000001790000012FD6937A64CB17F604.png[image,width=293,height=236]

Constants are terminals on the block diagram that supply fixed data
values to the diagram. We’ll discuss data types etc. later in the
session.

* Finally let’s wire in a couple of outputs.

image:Pictures/100000000000015000000117CAC9EE8F055265EF.png[image,width=335,height=278]

* Right-click on IDN for Initialize.vi and select ‘Create Indicator’.
Then we need an error out, so right click at the bottom the Close.vi and
select ‘Create Indicator’.

image:Pictures/1000000000000337000001C88E979705867B61C2.png[image,width=641,height=355]

Notice how the Indicators appear on the Front Panel. We’ll discuss
block-diagrams and front panels in a bit.

Now we have a running program!

However, you will notice the we’ll have an error.

image:Pictures/1000000000000337000001CAF795C47AA666140B.png[image,width=653,height=362]

* 
* We can interrogate the error message to try and get a clue as to why
it all went so wrong. Sometimes it can even be helpful.

image:Pictures/10000000000001A5000000CDF1085F0DF09FEADE.png[image,width=420,height=205]

In this case it is!

image:Pictures/10000000000002680000015CDA2FA29652DEA5C0.png[image,width=425,height=240]

* The VIs don’t know who they are talking to. To fix this, hardware
users need to set the correct VISA reference from the ‘VISA’ drop down
box.. For Emulator users click the ‘Copy’ button, as seen in the image
below and paste the reference in, if you have hardware refresh and
select the ASRL reference.

image:Pictures/1000020100000554000002B640463AF720808239.png[image,width=680,height=346]

* Now press run again.

Here we can see that no errors were apparent and Identity has a value.

image:Pictures/1000000000000337000001C8E8EF315CAA8C6E04.png[image,width=500,height=278]

But more importantly
image:Pictures/100000000000027D0000015B2F1D44B2D356D15C.png[image,width=431,height=235]the
LED on the hardware has turned on.

== [#anchor-4]##**Lesson 2 – **For Loops

=== [#anchor-5]####Optional: Setting up the Hardware

image:Pictures/10000201000003930000030165C94B1D606E5457.png[image,width=605,height=509]Wire
your hardware like the image
below.image:Pictures/10000000000004FB000002CDE0C3A99980ABFA3B.png[image,width=395,height=276]

=== [#anchor-6]####Lesson Instructions

A For Loop executes a sub-diagram a set number of times. In this case
you will learn how to build a program that will blink the previous LED
on and off 10 times each and then stop.

* Make your workspace bigger to allow space for adding objects. Use Ctrl
then drag to expand.

image:Pictures/1000020100000243000001212AC94671CAFB36A5.png[image,width=353,height=170]

image:Pictures/10000201000001EC000000EE628EBD663E5BC167.png[image,width=325,height=160]

* 
* Alternatively select the objects you need to move with the selection
tool and drag them where you want with the mouse, or using the arrows.

Note: press Shift and an arrow key to move selected items quicker.

* Now insert a For Loop, to do this right click anywhere on the block
diagram to bring up the functions palette. Select ‘Structures’ then ‘For
Loop’.

image:Pictures/100000000000036600000231B3B329720B17BF74.png[image,width=484,height=312]

* You will only need to place the For Loop around the WriteDO SubVI (and
the constants attached to it.)

* Once the For Loop has been placed, you will see an ‘N’ in the top left
corner, this is the loop count (or how many times the loop will
execute.)

* Right click on the left hand side of the Loop Count, and select
‘Create a Constant’. For this task you will need the Loop Count to be 20
(10 times on and 10 times off.)

image:Pictures/1000020100000366000002318134A4FE0313E790.png[image,width=476,height=307]

In order for the program to ‘blink’ successfully it will need to know
what the previous loop has executed, therefore you will need a Shift
Register.

* Right click on the edge of the For Loop and select ‘Add Shift
Register.’ Wire the True Constant to the Shift Registers and the DO
(Value) wire terminal.

image:Pictures/100002010000035F000001EE91868BA72B7DD1C1.png[image,width=306,height=196]image:Pictures/10000201000001930000012F23E1CE4C390CBE57.png[image,width=265,height=199]

If you were to run the program at this point the LED would light up, but
would not ‘blink.’

* For a blinking LED you will need to invert the boolean value after
every loop. To do this right click anywhere to bring up the functions
palette. Hover over ‘Boolean’ then select the ‘Not’ Boolean. Wire this
into the shift registers.

image:Pictures/10000201000003630000023DB067792B7A2B90E2.png[image,width=556,height=358]image:Pictures/1000000000000146000000FDDA7B7C4A86F83447.png[image,width=325,height=240]

The program will now work! However, it will execute very fast, and you
will not be able to see the LED blinking. So you need to slow the Loop
down.

* Right click inside the For Loop, hover over ‘Timing.’ There will see
many different timing options. For this you will use the ‘Wait’
function. Select and place inside the Loop.

* Create a constant by right clicking on the left side of the ‘Wait’
function. The ‘Wait’ function executes in milliseconds, therefore to
slow down the Loop by 5 seconds, write 500.

image:Pictures/100002010000050F0000037EA5D1685E99168628.png[image,width=591,height=341]

* Now Run the program. You have successfully used a For Loop to blink
the Digital Output.

== [#anchor-7]####Lesson 3 – While Loops

=== [#anchor-8]####Optional: Setting up the Hardware

Wire your hardware like the image below.

image:Pictures/10000201000003930000030165C94B1D606E5457.png[image,width=621,height=522]image:Pictures/10000000000004FB000002CDE0C3A99980ABFA3B.png[image,width=395,height=276]

=== [#anchor-9]####Lesson Instructions

The While Loop executes the sub-diagram until a specific condition
occurs. It will always execute at least one time.

In this case, you want the LED to continually blink on and off until a
‘Stop’ button is pressed. You can create this using the previously built
program with the For Loop.

* Firstly, right click on the edge of the For Loop, and select ‘Replace
with While Loop’

image:Pictures/1000020100000373000001DA9663B30AE37D4232.png[image,width=506,height=274]

* Now the For Loop has been replaced, the Loop Count is not connected.
This is not needed for a While Loop and can be deleted.

image:Pictures/10000201000003120000011B0AACC49326D2A5D6.png[image,width=521,height=183]

* To add a ‘Stop’ boolean, switch to the front panel window and right
click where you want to place the button. The Controls palette will
appear, select ‘Boolean’ and pick a button. The example uses a ‘Push
Button’ but any will work.

image:Pictures/1000020100000343000002C2BF5FD62D9AD7E1A0.png[image,width=518,height=438]

* Back on the Block Diagram move the new Control Boolean into the While
Loop and wire it up to the Conditional Terminal in the bottom right
corner. If the Button on the Front Panel is pressed when the program is
running then the Loop will end and the ‘blinking’ LED will stop.

== [#anchor-11]####Lesson 4 – Event Structure

=== [#anchor-12]####Optional: Setting up the Hardware

Wire your hardware like the image below.

image:Pictures/10000201000003930000030165C94B1D606E5457.png[image,width=613,height=515]image:Pictures/10000000000004FB000002CDE0C3A99980ABFA3B.png[image,width=395,height=276]

=== [#anchor-13]####Lesson Instructions

An Event Structure waits until a certain event occurs, then executes the
appropriate case to handle that event. In this example, we want to press
a buttons and the corresponding light to turn on.

* First lets delete the while loop and its contents. Click on the While
Loop and press the delete key. Do the same for the ‘True’ constant. Then
remove the broken wires with Ctrl+B.

image:Pictures/1000020100000292000001348324DDBAFF93D6D3.png[image,width=618,height=236]

image:Pictures/10000000000002CC000000E3D1CE16936C10ED2C.png[image,width=602,height=106]

* Right click to bring up the Functions Palette, hover over ‘Structures’
then select ‘Event Structure.’ Place the Event Structure on the Block
Diagram.

image:Pictures/1000020100000338000002821B30F14B83268F0D.png[image,width=618,height=481]

* Wire the Initialize VI and the Close VI through the Event Structure.
* image:Pictures/10000201000002FF00000156A3856844627E9BEA.png[image,width=480,height=214]Add
a new Event Case by right clicking on the Selector Label, and select
‘Add Event Case.’
* image:Pictures/100002010000033B000001F981CF6DE115363DBF.png[image,width=316,height=279]image:Pictures/10000201000005D70000039FB2949CC317CC2DD3.png[image,width=528,height=366]Add
the WriteDO.vi by bringing up the Functions Palette, hover over
‘Instrument I/O’, ‘Instr Drivers,’ ‘HandsOnPi2040,’ and select
‘WriteDO.vi.
* Drag the sub VI inside the Event Structure and wire it up. Right click
the Output terminal and create a Constant.
* image:Pictures/100002010000016C0000012D62B1799FC65FBB0F.png[image,width=316,height=261]Change
the Output from ‘No DO – Error’ to ‘DO1’ by clicking the drop down arrow
on the Output Constant.

image:Pictures/100002010000014D0000012705BB693656EF26D0.png[image,width=297,height=263]

* Next we need to add a button for the Digital Output. Go to the Front
Panel, and right click anywhere to bring up the Controls Palette. Hover
over ‘Boolean,’ and select ‘Push Button’
* image:Pictures/10000201000002DB000002CF3F5733874B7CC9FC.png[image,width=531,height=505]image:Pictures/100002010000014E0000012B7BF40CC1B6F19E27.png[image,width=334,height=299]Wire
the new Boolean Control into the ‘DO Value’ terminal.
* Right click on the Label Selector as we need to ‘Edit Events Handled
by This Case.’
* image:Pictures/10000201000001660000013C2ED62B0536FBFF8C.png[image,width=358,height=316]This
will bring up the ‘Edit Events’ window. Select ‘Boolean.’

image:Pictures/100002010000030C0000026080F4C7F0BE99289C.png[image,width=618,height=482]

* This Event Case is now complete. We will need 3 more Event Cases, each
one corresponding to a LED. The easiest way to do this is to right click
the Label Selector, and select ‘Duplicate Event Case.’
* image:Pictures/100002010000015F0000013A6C0307EDBAE30F54.png[image,width=351,height=314]Select
‘Boolean 2’ on the Edit Events window.

image:Pictures/100002010000030B00000260C65E38B60578DC61.png[image,width=618,height=482]

* It’s important to change the DO Constant when the case has been
duplicated. (DO1 for Boolean, DO2 for Boolean 2, etc.) Duplicate this
case 2 more times for DO3, and DO4.
* image:Pictures/10000201000001530000012C82BEEF52D2B95BC3.png[image,width=338,height=300]At
this point your Front Panel may look a little messy, take some time to
clean it up. This will make it easier to use when you have finished
building the program.

image:Pictures/1000020100000152000000E39F9D8623AD8AC52E.png[image,width=338,height=226]image:Pictures/100002010000013A000000EBD0F1A6E815D6B8C1.png[image,width=308,height=230]You
will be able to Run the program now, however, it will Stop after one
Boolean has been selected. We can make this more efficient.

* Back on the Block Diagram we will need to add a While Loop. Right
click to bring up the Functions Palette, hover over ‘Structures’ and
select ‘While Loop.’
* image:Pictures/100002010000024600000298A1DCC5CEE0314256.png[image,width=505,height=576]image:Pictures/10000201000001C8000001955FCB6BF08C0937AF.png[image,width=391,height=348]Place
the While Loop around the Event Structure.
+
* Go to the Front Panel, so we can add a ‘Stop’ button that we’ll
connect to the Loop Condition. Right click to bring up the Controls
Palette, hover over ‘Boolean, then select ‘Stop Button.’
* image:Pictures/10000201000002B60000022D8024972D6EFF9511.png[image,width=618,height=496]image:Pictures/100002010000025F000001E8692AF4F374556359.png[image,width=607,height=402]We
will also need to create a new Event Case for this Stop button. Right
click on the Selector Label and select ‘Add Event Case.’
+
* Place the ‘Stop’ control inside the new case.
* image:Pictures/10000201000001BD000001942166127156529996.png[image,width=445,height=403]Right
click the Selector Label and select ‘Edit Events Handled by This Case’

image:Pictures/10000201000001FC0000019AFCBA1D6EF453119D.png[image,width=508,height=410]

* When the ‘Edit Events’ window pops up choose the ‘stop’ option in the
‘Event Sources’ table.
* image:Pictures/10000201000003130000026762BBF00EADEB6910.png[image,width=618,height=483]Our
last step is to wire a ‘True’ constant to the Loop condition. Right
click to bring up the Functions Palette, hover over ‘Boolean’ and select
‘True Constant.’
* Place the Constant inside the Event Structure.
+
image:Pictures/10000201000002B60000025E1DA9C3313573E43A.png[image,width=472,height=412]
* Wire the constant to the Loop Condition, like the image below.
* image:Pictures/10000201000001BE00000193DCE0F91297DFC428.png[image,width=413,height=373]The
program will now run successfully. You will be able to turn the LEDs on
and off as many times as you want. You can use the Stop button to stop
the execution of the program.

=== [#anchor-16]####Lesson Instructions

==== [#anchor-17]####Analog Input

Now you have made working programs using Digital Inputs and Outputs,
it’s time to have a look at the Analog Inputs and Outputs.

For this lesson you will be focusing on the Analog Inputs.

image:Pictures/10000201000003DB000003623B6B1D0F5E7D1A11.png[image,width=473,height=415]image:Pictures/100002010000015D0000022C7527E2FBC696CF0B.png[image,width=130,height=227]

* Like the lessons before, start with placing the Initialize.vi, and the
Close.vi on a new Block Diagram.

* Right click to bring up the Functions Palette. Follow along with the
image below and place the ReadAI.vi on the diagram.
* image:Pictures/10000201000004BA000003B1BCF5AFB7B8EF2703.png[image,width=548,height=428]You
want to create a constant by right clicking on Analog Input on the left
of the ReadAIs.vi, and selecting Create Constant.

* image:Pictures/100002010000033F000002F0FD9024F38611D482.png[image,width=398,height=360]Create
an Indicator for the Analog value on the right side of the vi.
* image:Pictures/1000000000000268000000FC858524B7BC054B39.png[image,width=417,height=96]Wire
your program like the image below.
+
The program will successfully run at this point, however, it will
execute too fast to move the Analog Sticks for continuous data.

While Loop will not work without adding a Loop Condition. In most cases
this will simply be a Stop Boolean. Right click on the Loop Condition
and ‘Create Control’.

you are using physical Pico Bread Board and Analog Board you will notice
the ‘Value’ Indicator will flicker between numbers, this is normal and
is simply extra ‘noise’ from the equipment.

with a Block Diagram with an Initialize.vi and a Close.vi. Right click
to bring up the Functions Palette. Follow along with the image below and
add the WriteAO.vi onto the diagram.
* Wire up the 3 VIs.
* Right click on the ‘Analog Output’ terminal and Create a Constant. For
this exercise the Analog Output will produce 2 different pieces of
numerical data, therefore 2 constants will be grouped

a Cluster.

image:Pictures/1000020100000044000000961E71DDDB04AD0C42.png[image,width=36,height=79]

* You will need to create a Bundle. Right click on the Block Diagram to
bring up the Functions palette, hover over ‘Cluster, Class, & Variant,
then select ‘Bundle By Name.’

* Delete the wire connected to the subVI, as it needs to be wired into
the bundle you built before.
* image:Pictures/1000020100000112000000C821EBA7FC7AB49C5A.png[image,width=207,height=151]Wire

you will notice that the bundle has the label ‘Duty’. Expand the Bundle
down so the ‘Frequency’ label is
visiimage:Pictures/10000201000000DC000000C4885C9DE58C6D062E.png[image,width=196,height=174]ble.
* Right click at the edge of the bundle and create Constants for ‘Duty’
and ‘Frequency.’

adjusting.
+
_Using ‘Numeric Control’ may be a little fiddly when the program runs,
so in this case you will swap these out for ‘Vertical Pointer Slides.’_
* image:Pictures/100002010000022D000001D858C32932C7AF9AEA.png[image,width=382,height=298]image:Pictures/100000000000008C000000AE269AA1DB2BE1505A.png[image,width=108,height=134]Right
click on the ‘Duty’ Control and hover over ‘Replace.’ Select ‘Numeric’
and then ‘Vertical Pointer Slide.’ Do the same for the ‘Frequency’
Control.
* image:Pictures/100002010000021F000001BFA380DBA7C8F34BFB.png[image,width=486,height=400]You
will need to change the ‘Scale’ of the ‘Frequency’ slider. Right click
on the Slider, select ‘Scale’, ‘Mapping’, then ‘Logarithmic.’

_A logarithmic scale is useful when the data you are displaying is much
less or much more than the rest of the data, or when the percentage
differences between values are important. _

* The ‘Duty’ slider can stay as a Linear scale.
* image:Pictures/10000201000000D7000000EDBBACE07AE141E37D.png[image,width=148,height=183]image:Pictures/10000201000000FE000000C79012D6312FC25E4A.png[image,width=178,height=184]Now
you need to set the top and bottom points on the sliders. You will only
need to change the highest point for ‘Duty’. Set it to ‘1’.
* For ‘Frequency’ the lowest point should be ‘10’ and the highest
‘500,000.’

Now let’s head back to the Block Diagram and finish building the
program.

* image:Pictures/100002010000027900000151000F79335E1B6B35.png[image,width=370,height=336]Bring
up the Functions Palette by right clicking on the Block Diagram, hover
over ‘Structures’ and select a For Loop. Place the For Loop around the
WriteAO.vi.
* A For Loop needs a ‘Loop Count.’ Choose a number that will allow you
to time to use the dials and see how it executes on the Waveform Chart.

image:Pictures/100002010000012D000000A7088DF62399ECFF01.png[image,width=301,height=167]

* You will need to slow down the Program before running it. Bring up the
Functions Palette, select ‘Timing’ and place the ‘Wait (ms)’ function
inside the For Loop.
* Righimage:Pictures/100002010000034E0000026195BD5436163DE4AD.png[image,width=519,height=374]t
click the left hand terminal on the Wait function and create a Constant.
Type in ‘100’ this will slow the program down enough for you to see the
results.

can now run your program. Move the Vertical Pointer Slides up and down
and you will be results will show on the Emulator.

==== [#anchor-21]####Analog Output (Read)

If you want a more accurate representation for the ‘Duty’ and
‘Frequency’ sliders you can use the ReadAOs.vi.

Place the ReadAOs.vi inside the For Loop by repeat the same process you
learnt at the beginning of the

the subVI as show in the image below. Right click on the ‘AnalogOutput’
terminal and create a Constant, then create an Indicator for the
‘AnOutValues.’
* image:Pictures/1000020100000158000000AED1A9006DCDA3030F.png[image,width=218,height=110]You
can now run the program, and you will see the Values for ‘Duty’ and
‘Frequency’ on the Front Panel.

== [#anchor-22]####General Concepts

=== [#anchor-23]####VIs (Virtual Instruments)

Programs in LabVIEW are called VIs (Virtual Instruments). In other
programming languages a VI is similar to a function or a subroutine. A
VI includes a Front Panel and a Block Diagram, the VIs Icon and its
Connector Pane.

* Front Panel
+
The front panel window is the user interface for the VI. You create the
window with controls and indicators, these are the interactive input and
output terminals of the VI.
+
* Block Diagram
+
The Block Diagram is where you will create the code for your program.
The block diagram will implement graphical representations of functions
to control the objects on the front panel. Objects on the front panel
will appear as terminals on the block diagram.
+
* Icons, Connector Panes, and SubVIs
+
The icon and connector pane allow you to use and view the VI in another
VI. This is called a SubVI, to use a SubVI you must build a connector
pane. Customising the Icon is recommended to help with reading and
understanding the program.
** The Icon is displayed in the upper right corner of the VI, it is a
graphical representation of the VI. The icon can be customised with text
and images to help identify what the VI does.
** The connector pane is a set of terminals on the icon the corresponds
to the controls and indicators of the VI.

=== 

=== [#anchor-24]####Data **T**ypes

Each variable in a program must have a data type. The data types
determines what type of value the variable will hold.

Numeric –

* Integer (int) – whole numbers (e.g., -700, 0, 700)
* Floating point (float) – numbers with fractions (decimals) (e.g.,
700.0, 0.7)

Boolean – represents 2 states (e.g., true, or false, 1 or 0)

String – sequence of characters, digits, or symbols – always treated as
text (e.g., hello)

Enumerated type – predefined unique values (can be text or numerical)
(e.g., rock (0) jazz (1)

Character – a single letter, digit, punctuation mark, symbol, or blank
space.

Array – stores multiple elements in a specific order. Note: black means
no datatype selected. Drop another datatype into the array to make an
array of that datatype.

image:Pictures/1000020100000451000000F3ECA8E5829661F30E.png[image,width=734,height=161]

_Note: right click on a data type terminal and select ‘View as Icon’
depending on your preference. (The 2_^_nd_^_ row shows the terminals as
icons.)_

=== 

=== [#anchor-25]####While Loops

While Loops allow portions of a program to execute repeatedly until a
certain condition is met.

[arabic]
. image:Pictures/1000020100000128000000DFE232CC16178E3979.png[image,width=257,height=190]Iteration
Terminal – the iteration terminal provides the current loop iteration.
+
. Conditional Terminal – Evaluates a Boolean input value at the end of
each loop iteration, if the conditional terminal is met then the loop
stops.
+

=== [#anchor-26]####For Loops

A For Loop executes a sub-diagram a certain number of times. This value
is wired to the Count Terminal (N).

image:Pictures/100002010000011A000000D9C3EC0DAD379A8176.png[image,width=275,height=210]

[arabic]
. Iteration Loop – Indicates the number of completed iterations.
+
. Count Terminal – Specifies the number of times to execute the code
inside the For Loop.

=== [#anchor-27]####Event Structures

An Event Structure waits until an event occurs, then executes the
appropriate case to handle that event.

image:Pictures/1000020100000116000000D88A2A753B54F7230E.png[image,width=298,height=232]

[arabic]
. The event selector label specifies which events cause the displayed
case to execute.
+
. The Timeout terminals specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for
an event before timing out.

[arabic]
. The Event Data Node identifies the data LabVIEW returns when an event
occurs
